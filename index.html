            Hi there, my name is Pijus, I'm ArklyGamerYT youtube channel owner
            and ps4 console gamer. I like playing console games and sharing the
            best action with the world. There is a Rainbow Six Siege game with
            descriptions of the game, game modes, and I looking for 4 guys or
            girls to join my team, where we can play events and beat the other
            teams. The random players are not always friendly and kind. The game
            is really funny and tricky when you need to beat the opposite team.
            Also, I'm an English speaker and will be nice to find players to
            play this game. We could collaborate and win the game.

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <div class="game-play-1">
          <p>
            Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person shooter game, in
            which players utilize many different operators from the Rainbow
            team. Different operators have different nationalities, weapons, and
            gadgets. The game features an asymmetrical structure whereby the
            teams are not always balanced in their choices of abilities. The
            base Counter-Terrorism Units (CTUs) available for play are the
            American Hostage Rescue Team (referred to in-game as the FBI SWAT),
            the British SAS, the German GSG-9, the Russian Spetsnaz and the
            French GIGN, each of which has four operators per unit split between
            attackers and defenders (other units were later added through
            downloadable content, see below). Players also have access to a
            "Recruit" operator who can choose from a more flexible assortment of
            equipment at the expense of having a unique gadget or the ability to
            customize their weapon. Players can pick any operator from any unit
            that is defending or attacking before a round starts, choosing spawn
            points as well as attachments on their guns but are not allowed to
            change their choices once the round has started. An in-game shop
            allows players to purchase operators or cosmetics using the in-game
            currency, "Renown", which is earned at the end of matches from
            actions performed in-game. Different gameplay modes award renown at
            different rates, with ranked matches offering the largest renown
            multiplier potential per match. Players can also complete in-game
            "challenges" to get a small amount of renown. Renown gain rate can
            also be affected by the using in-game "boosters" which gives the
            player an increase in all renown earned for various duration,
            starting with 24 hours. A premium currency known as "R6 credits" can
            also be purchased using real-world currency to get operators quicker
            in-game, or other cosmetic items, such as weapon or operator skins.

            When the round begins in an online match, the attackers choose one
            of several spawn points from which to launch their attack while
            defenders do the same from which to defend from. A one-minute
            preparatory period will then commence wherein the attackers are then
            given control over mecanum-wheeled drones to scout the map in search
            of enemy operators, traps and defensive set-ups in addition to the
            target objective(s), while the defenders establish their defences
            and are encouraged to do so without having the defensive and target
            objective(s) details being discovered, chiefly through destroying
            the drones. Maps in the game are designed to encourage close
            quarters combat, and players cannot respawn until the end of a
            round. Players who were killed by opponents can enter "Support
            Mode", which allows them to gain access to drone's cameras and
            security cameras so that they can continue to contribute to their
            team by informing them of opponent locations and activities. Matches
            last only four minutes for a casual and three minutes for a ranked.
            Teamwork and cooperation are encouraged in Siege, and players need
            to take advantage of their different abilities in order to complete
            the objective and defeat the enemy team. Communication between
            players is also heavily encouraged. The game also has a spectator
            mode, which allows players to observe a match from different angles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game features a heavy emphasis on environmental destruction
            using a procedural destruction system. Players can break structures
            by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes.
            Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental
            destruction, and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize
            creativity and strategy. A bullet-penetration system is featured, in
            which bullets that pass through structures deal less damage to
            enemies. In addition to destruction, players on the defending team
            can also set up a limited number of heavy-duty fortifications on
            walls and deployable shields around them for protection; these can
            be destroyed through breaching devices, explosives, or by utilizing
            operator specific gadgets in the case of the former. In order to
            stop attackers' advance, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire
            and explosive laser wire traps around the maps. Vertical space is a
            key gameplay element in the game's maps: players can destroy
            ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by
            rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades and
            breach charges are valuable, as only a limited amount can be used in
            a round.

            At launch, the game featured 11 maps and 5 different gameplay modes
            spanning both PVE and PVP. With the downloadable content (DLC)
            released post-launch with an additional four maps from year one and
            three maps from year two â€“ there are currently 20 playable maps. The

            <p>
              Hostage: a non-competitive multiplayer mode, in which the
              attackers must extract the hostage from the defenders, while the
              defenders must prevent that from happening either by eliminating
              all of the attacking team or successfully defending the hostage
              until the time expires. A secondary manner of winning can occur if
              the attacking or defending team accidentally damages the hostage,
              causing the hostage to "down"; if the opposing team can prevent
              the revival of the hostage, and the hostage bleeds-out and dies,
              they will win the round.

              Bomb: a competitive multiplayer mode, in which the attackers are
              tasked with locating and defusing one of two bombs. The defenders
              must stop the attackers by killing all of them or destroying the
              defuser. If all attackers are killed after the defuser is planted,
              the defuser must still be destroyed for a defending victory.

              defenders must protect a room with a biohazard container, while
              the attackers must fight their way in and secure it. The match
              ends when all players from one team are killed or the biohazard
              container is secured by the attackers when there are no defenders
              in the room.

            <p>
              Tactical Realism: a variation of the standard competitive
              multiplayer modes, added with the release of the Operation Skull
              Rain DLC. The game mode features a heavier emphasis on realism and
              teamwork, removing most of the heads-up display (HUD) elements,
              the ability to mark opponents, and the ability to see teammates'
              contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a
              realistic ammo management system. This mode is no longer in the
              game but some aspects are in the other multiplayer modes.
