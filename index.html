        <p>
          Hi there, my name is Pijus, I'm ArklyGamerYT youtube channel owner and
          ps4 console gamer. I like playing console games and sharing the best
          action with the world. There is a Rainbow Six Siege game with
          descriptions of the game, game modes, and I looking for 4 guys or
          girls to join my team, where we can play events and beat the other
          teams. The random players are not always friendly and kind. The game
          is really funny and tricky when you need to beat the opposite team.
          Also, I'm an English speaker and will be nice to find players to play
          this game. We could collaborate and win the game.

          <h2>Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
        </header>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person shooter game, in
          which players utilize many different operators from the Rainbow team.
          Different operators have different nationalities, weapons, and
          gadgets. The game features an asymmetrical structure whereby the teams
          are not always balanced in their choices of abilities. The base
          Counter-Terrorism Units (CTUs) available for play are the American
          Hostage Rescue Team (referred to in-game as the FBI SWAT), the British
          SAS, the German GSG-9, the Russian Spetsnaz and the French GIGN, each
          of which has four operators per unit split between attackers and
          defenders (other units were later added through downloadable content,
          see below). Players also have access to a "Recruit" operator who can
          choose from a more flexible assortment of equipment at the expense of
          having a unique gadget or the ability to customize their weapon.
          Players can pick any operator from any unit that is defending or
          attacking before a round starts, choosing spawn points as well as
          attachments on their guns but are not allowed to change their choices
          once the round has started. An in-game shop allows players to purchase
          operators or cosmetics using the in-game currency, "Renown", which is
          earned at the end of matches from actions performed in-game. Different
          gameplay modes award renown at different rates, with ranked matches
          offering the largest renown multiplier potential per match. Players
          can also complete in-game "challenges" to get a small amount of
          renown. Renown gain rate can also be affected by the using in-game
          "boosters" which gives the player an increase in all renown earned for
          various duration, starting with 24 hours. A premium currency known as
          "R6 credits" can also be purchased using real-world currency to get
          operators quicker in-game, or other cosmetic items, such as weapon or
          operator skins .
        </p>
        <p>
          When the round begins in an online match, the attackers choose one of
          several spawn points from which to launch their attack while defenders
          do the same from which to defend from. A one-minute preparatory period
          will then commence wherein the attackers are then given control over
          mecanum-wheeled drones to scout the map in search of enemy operators,
          traps and defensive set-ups in addition to the target objective(s),
          while the defenders establish their defences and are encouraged to do
          so without having the defensive and target objective(s) details being
          discovered, chiefly through destroying the drones. Maps in the game
          are designed to encourage close quarters combat, and players cannot
          respawn until the end of a round.[citation needed] Players who were
          killed by opponents can enter "Support Mode", which allows them to
          gain access to drone's cameras and security cameras so that they can
          continue to contribute to their team by informing them of opponent
          locations and activities. Matches last only four minutes for a casual
          and three minutes for a ranked. Teamwork and cooperation are
          encouraged in Siege, and players need to take advantage of their
          different abilities in order to complete the objective and defeat the
          enemy team. Communication between players is also heavily encouraged.
          The game also has a spectator mode, which allows players to observe a
          match from different angles. The game features a heavy emphasis on
          environmental destruction using a procedural destruction system.
          Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot
          walls to make bullet holes. Players may gain tactical advantages
          through environmental destruction, and the system aims at encouraging
          players to utilize creativity and strategy. A bullet-penetration
          system is featured, in which bullets that pass through structures deal
          less damage to enemies. In addition to destruction, players on the
          defending team can also set up a limited number of heavy-duty
          fortifications on walls and deployable shields around them for
          protection; these can be destroyed through breaching devices,
          explosives, or by utilizing operator specific gadgets in the case of
          the former. In order to stop attackers' advance, defenders can place
          traps like barbed-wire and explosive laser wire traps around the maps.
          Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps: players
          can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush
          enemies by rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades
          and breach charges are valuable, as only a limited amount can be used
          in a round.
        </p>
        <h3>Modes</h3>
        <p>
          At launch, the game featured 11 maps and 5 different gameplay modes
          spanning both PVE and PVP. With the downloadable content (DLC)
          released post-launch with an additional four maps from year one and
          three maps from year two – there are currently 20 playable maps. The
          gameplay modes featured include:

            <p>
              Hostage: a non-competitive multiplayer mode, in which the
              attackers must extract the hostage from the defenders, while the
              defenders must prevent that from happening either by eliminating
              all of the attacking team or successfully defending the hostage
              until the time expires. A secondary manner of winning can occur if
              the attacking or defending team accidentally damages the hostage,
              causing the hostage to "down"; if the opposing team can prevent
              the revival of the hostage, and the hostage bleeds-out and dies,
              they will win the round.

              Bomb: a competitive multiplayer mode, in which the attackers are
              tasked with locating and defusing one of two bombs. The defenders
              must stop the attackers by killing all of them or destroying the
              defuser. If all attackers are killed after the defuser is planted,
              the defuser must still be destroyed for a defending victory.

              Secure Area: a non-competitive multiplayer mode, in which the
              defenders must protect a room with a biohazard container, while
              the attackers must fight their way in and secure it. The match
              ends when all players from one team are killed or the biohazard
              container is secured by the attackers when there are no defenders
              in the room.

            <p>
              Tactical Realism: a variation of the standard competitive
              multiplayer modes, added with the release of the Operation Skull
              Rain DLC. The game mode features a heavier emphasis on realism and
              teamwork, removing most of the heads-up display (HUD) elements,
              the ability to mark opponents, and the ability to see teammates'
              contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a
              realistic ammo management system. This mode is no longer in the
              game but some aspects are in the other multiplayer modes.

        <h3>Game modes</h3>
        <p>
          Fortnite is distributed as three different game modes, using the same
          engine; each has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="sub-title">Fortnite: Save the World</span> is a
            player-versus-environment cooperative game, with four players
            collaborating towards a common objective on various missions. The
            game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of
            the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by
            zombie-like "husks". The players take the role of commanders of home
            base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending
            equipment that helps to either collect data on the storm or to push
            back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of
            in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap
            schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through
            gained experience to improve their attributes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="sub-title">Fortnite Battle Royale</span> is a
            player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to
            play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or
            four players). Weaponless players airdrop from a "Battle Bus" that
            crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for
            weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay
            alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of
            a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an
            incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and
            can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces
            remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player
            encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="sub-title">Fortnite Creative</span> is a sandbox game
            mode, similar to Minecraft in that players are given complete
            freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island,
            and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses,
            platforming challenges, and more.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the
          map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal.
          Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to
          build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such
          fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or
          doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can
          be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type.
          Within Save the World this enables players to create defensive
          fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure
          husks through. In Battle Royale, this provides the means to quickly
          traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an
          advancing foe. Players are encouraged to be very inventive in
          designing their fortifications in Creative.

          While Battle Royale and Creative are free-to-play, Save the World is
          pay-to-play. The games are monetized through the use of V-Bucks,
          in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also
          earned through completing missions and other achievements in Save the
          World. V-Bucks in Save the World can be used to buy loot boxes, in the
          form of piñatas shaped like llamas, to gain a random selection of
          items. In Battle Royale, V-Bucks can be used to buy cosmetic items
          like character models or the like, or can also be used to purchase the
          game's battle pass, a tiered progression of customization rewards for
          gaining experience and completing certain objectives during the course
          of a Battle Royale season.

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure game
          with stealth elements and played from a third-person perspective as
          Marcus Holloway, a young hacker. The game features an open world set
          in a fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area more
          than twice as large as the Chicagoland setting from Watch Dogs. It
          consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and
          Silicon Valley. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by
          the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks,
          buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes, and boats. The driving
          mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The player
          can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved
          acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. The
          player can use different methods to approach the game's missions,
          choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies
          with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or
          Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord.
          Alternatively, the player can use the stealth approach, in which they
          can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser.
          Watch Dogs 2, like its predecessor, places a particular emphasis on
          using environmental apparatus and the terrain to Marcus' advantage.
          For example, a player may hack an A/C unit to produce an electric
          shock when an enemy nears it. Marcus may also employ his own modular
          taser devices and explosives to use tactically against enemies. When
          law enforcement witnesses the player committing a crime, or is alerted
          by a non-player character (NPC), police officers will attempt to
          arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature,
          with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and
          Trickster. Upgrades can be customized according to playstyles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marcus can hack into various electronic devices connected to the ctOS
          system with his in-game smartphone. For example, Marcus can modify the
          personal information of NPCs to have them arrested or attacked by one
          of the various gangs such as the 580s, the Tezcas, the Auntie Shu
          Boys, the Bratva or the Sons of Ragnarok, hack and manipulate every
          mobile phone featured in the game, disrupt traffic by hacking cars and
          traffic lights, hack into monitoring cameras, and carry out "mass
          hacking", which hacks the electrical equipment of a large group of
          people. The player can also gain multiple options while hacking the
          same object. For instance, if the player attempts to hack a car, they
          can gain direct control over them, or have the car lose control and
          crash in a random direction. Unlike Aiden, the protagonist of the
          first game, Marcus has an arsenal of advanced equipment, including a
          quadcopter and remote-controlled car, both of which can be used for
          remote hacking and scouting. Marcus' apparel can be customized with
          over 700 articles of clothing, available for purchase in stores that
          maintain fashion styles unique to what is worn by the denizens in each
          area. The game features several main story missions, and side-missions
          known as "operations". Once completed, Marcus' follower count will
          increase.
